# City of Austin Open Data Manual

## about this repo

This repo is the central collaboration hub for managing the City of Austin's Open Data Manual. It hosts the content of the Open Data Manual, tracks to-do list items, and explains how the manual works.

To keep the manual updated and accessible, we do the following:

1. Write and update the information in the manual
2. Perform technical work to keep the manual website functioning 
3. Teach people how to help us do these two things


## current projects include (get involved!)

- [review the data portal terms of use](https://github.com/cityofaustin/open-data-manual/milestone/11)
- [create a dashboard that shows where we're at in developing the open data manual](https://github.com/cityofaustin/open-data-manual/milestone/12)

## for developers

The Open Data Manual documentation is written in reStructured text markup and converted to HTML by a documentation generator called [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/index.html).

The HTML generated by Sphinx is served by [readthedocs.org](https://readthedocs.org/). Readthedocs.org watches the `master` branch of this repo. When changes are detected, readthedocs.org will  re-build the open data manual using Sphinx and publish the updated site to http://open-data-manual.readthedocs.io

More details and step by step instructions for forking this repo and developing locally using Sphinx will be added to the wiki, hopefully sooner rather than later.
