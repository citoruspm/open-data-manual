**Why is a data inventory important?**

The following is from the Sunlight Foundation's Open Data Policy Guidelines

(Source: http://sunlightfoundation.com/opendataguidelines/)

"For an open data policy to have a strong foundation, you first need to know what data you have—and so does the public. Governments should conduct an inventory of existing data early in the process of open data policy development in order for the government and other stakeholders to be aware of the full potential dimensions of data release. While defining total information holdings may be a complex undertaking, governments should conduct as comprehensive a review of existing data information as possible, with the inclusion of information holdings that may benefit from becoming structured data themselves." 

"The inventory should itself be made public. Publicly accounting for agency information helps ensure that information is managed to benefit the public interest, allows for common understanding of what data the government holds, and can create efficiencies among government departments. It empowers policymakers and administrators to determine whether information is being appropriately managed, and empowers the public oversight of those determinations. An individual or group should be charged with oversight of the inventory to ensure its ongoing maintenance and accuracy. To make the listing of data as useful as possible, such a list should also encompass data that may be viewed as sensitive or unlikely to be released (along with any other helpful context.) In addition to setting the stage for meaningful public discussions around dataset release, an inventory process can provide a roadmap for creating ambitious timelines (see Provision 27) and identify whether new data may need to be collected."



## City Data Inventory Background

On April 8, 2015, the City Manager issued a memorandum directing all departments to participate in the City of Austin Open Data Initiative 2.0. Included in that memorandum was a requirement that each department create an inventory of known data that it managed and maintained that would indicate:

a. If the information is publicly-accessible;  
b. The date of when the information was made publicly-accessible or when it is scheduled to be made public;  
c. The date the information was last updated or when it is scheduled to be updated;  
d. If the data is in a consumable format;  
e. If the information is from a primary source or has been aggregated or modified; and  
f. If the information is restricted by any legal, license or privacy restrictions.

Additional guidelines set forth by CTM were that the inventory should:

* Include all data that that is considered “public.” Public data is any data that does not have legal or privacy restrictions and would be subject to Texas Public Information Act requirements. And to include data that is considered “private” in its entirety but that can be shared or considered “public” if sensitive/restricted fields are removed when published. 

* List data sets that are published, planned for publication, that are available online in other formats (pdf, doc, etc.) or those that currently have no plans for publication. Data sets identified as “not for publication” must be accompanied by a justification that will be reviewed by the Open Government Executive Board for exemption.

The initial working version of the dataset inventory was published in Sharepoint for internal use only and included the following fields:

* Description  
* Dataset Title  
* Publication Status  
* Justification  
* Planned Date  
* Data Type  
* Upload Frequency

## Current City Data Inventory Policies

This is where we describe the current policies concerning the data inventory.

This includes includes policies on:

- Keeping inventory fresh
- On release of inventory i.e. publication of the inventory itself
- Etc


## City Data Inventory Procedures

This is where we describe the current procedures for creating the data inventory.

This should include the procedures for

- Researching and gathering the information
-   Referring to the San Francisco 3 step model
- Processing and incorporating into AirTable
-   This can include information on importing into AirTable
