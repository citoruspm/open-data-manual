## How to contribute as a developer

##### Our current workflow

1. If you aren't employed by the City of Austin, please review our [Contributor's Agreement](https://www.clahub.com/agreements/cityofaustin/open-data-manual)
2. Fork from the `develop` branch
3. Please try to keep your fixes and features organized appropriately in commits and branches. Great advice on doing that can be found [here](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/). *Just try your best, no worries =)*
4. Pull requests will be reviewed by content stewards, and upon approval, accepted and merged into `develop`
5. When the timing is right, we'll merge `develop` with `gh-pages` to update the [manual](http://opendata.rocks).
