### About this document


This document explains how to use metadata to describe open data assets held by the City of Austin. By using a common and consistent metadata vocabulary across City departments, we can make it easier for people to discover and use City information. 

**When would someone use these metadata standards?**

* An open data liaison publishing a new resource to the City's open data portal
* A City web developer wanting to make a department's open data offerings more discoverable by search engines
* A member of the public looking for a dataset to use in a project

**What does the metadata standard contain?**

* A list of descriptors (metadata elements) that should be provided whenever a dataset is published on the open data portal
* Description of when to use the metadata elements
* Details about how to use each element correctly

#### Design principles

* Be interoperable with existing standards such as those developed by the Federal Government and popular web search engines
* Start small and increase the number of elements over time
* Develop openly and in close collaboration with end users

# When to use these metadata elements:

#### Required
Use of the standard metadata elements is required when publishing any dataset to the open data portal. The metadata values should also be included in the open data inventory. 
> An open dataset is a table, map, or any other resource that is published to the open data portal.

#### Optional
Any time a public dataset is shared internally or publically, it is beneficial to include these metadata elements in a note or accessory file that accompanies the share. All City of Austin staff and partners are welcome to use this standard. 

# List of required elements:

Element name | Definition | Format/Example 
--- | --- | --- 
`Title` | Human-readable name of the asset. Should be in plain English and include sufficient detail to facilitate search and discovery. | 
`Description` | Human-readable description (e.g., an abstract) with sufficient detail to enable a user to quickly understand whether the asset is of interest. | 
`Last Update` | Most recent date on which the dataset was changed, updated or modified. | 
`Department Budget Code`  | The code for the COA Department represented by the dataset, as listed by the Budget Office. (needs link to dataset) | 
`Publisher` | The publishing entity and optionally their parent organization(s). | 
`Tags` | Tags (or keywords) help users discover your dataset; please include terms that would be used by technical and non-technical users. | 


# List of optional elements: 

Element name | Definition | Format/Example 
--- | --- | --- 
`_` | |
