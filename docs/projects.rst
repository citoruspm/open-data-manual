Past and current projects
===================================

At Austin's Open Data Initiative, we work on projects for 1-3 months at a time. These project periods are called sprints. 

Beginning with Sprint 2.3, we've developed individual scope and charter documents for each project. These documents, along with working documents and end-of-project reports, can be browsed at our separate site for sprint documentation -- `sprints.opendata.rocks <http://open-data-sprints.rtfd.org>`_.
