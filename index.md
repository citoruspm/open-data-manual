#### Open Data Initiative Sprint 2.1 *kicks off on Tuesday, February 16!*

 This session will be one you won’t want to miss! Join us at [Capitol Factory](https://capitalfactory.com/), one of Austin's hottest local tech incubator spaces! They are graciously opening their doors to us and sincerely want to support our efforts to make Austin an even better place to live through open data. In addition to presenting our sprint ideas, setting expectations, and forming action teams for the next 90 days, we'll take an insiders' tour of Capitol Factory's awesome coworking and meeting space.

### Status of documents and site "things to do":



<!-- 
<p>Every document is a work in progress. (Coming soon), look for these badges to find out the development status of each document:</p>

<h4>Discovery <span class="badge discovery">?</span></h4>

<p>A short phase in which we start researching the needs of the document's users, find out what we should be measuring, and explore technological or policy-related constraints.</p>

<h4>Alpha <span class="badge alpha">a</span></h4>

<p>A short phase in which we prototype solutions for the document. We’ll be testing with a small group of users or stakeholders and getting early feedback about the document's content and layout.</p>

<h4>Beta <span class="badge beta">b</span></h4>

<p>We’re developing against the demands of a live environment, understanding how to review and revise while meeting user needs. We’ll also be releasing a version to test in public.</p>

<h4>Live <span class="badge live">L</span></h4>

<p>The document is considered "in effect", however work doesn’t stop at this stage. We’ll be iteratively improving the document, reacting to new needs and demands, and keeping track of the changes as we go.</p>
