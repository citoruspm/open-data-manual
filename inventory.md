## Background on City of Austin Data Inventory

On April 8, 2015, the City Manager issued a memorandum directing all departments to participate in the City of Austin Open Data Initiative 2.0. Included in that memorandum was a requirement that each department create an inventory of known data managed and maintained that would indicate:

a. If the information is publicly-accessible;  
b. The date of when the information was made publicly-accessible or when it is scheduled to be made public;  
c. The date the information was last updated or when it is scheduled to be updated;  
d. If the data is in a consumable format;  
e. If the information is from a primary source or has been aggregated or modified; and  
f. If the information is restricted by any legal, license or privacy restrictions.
