### About this document


This document explains how to use metadata to describe open data assets held by the City of Austin. 

Scenarios in which someone would use these metadata standards include:

* An open data liaison publishing a new resource to the City's open data portal
* A City web developer wanting to make a department's open data offerings more discoverable by search engines
* A member of the public looking for a dataset to use in a project


There are many ways to use metadata. Our current goal is to increase the use of common, consistent metadata labels across City departments. 

#### Design principles

* Be interoperable with existing standards such as those developed by the Federal Government and popular web search engines
* Start small and increase the number of elements over time
* Develop openly and in close collaboration with end users

#### Additional resources
* Metadata FAQ (coming soon)
* Open Data FAQ (coming soon)

# List of standard metadata elements

#### What elements are always required?

--- | --- | --- 
`Title` | Human-readable name of the asset. Should be in plain English and include sufficient detail to facilitate search and discovery. | 
`Description` | Human-readable description (e.g., an abstract) with sufficient detail to enable a user to quickly understand whether the asset is of interest. | 
`Last Update` | Most recent date on which the dataset was changed, updated or modified. | 
`Department Budget Code`  | The code for the COA Department represented by the dataset, as listed by the Budget Office. (needs link to dataset) |
