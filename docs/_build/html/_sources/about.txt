About Austin's Open Data Initiative
===================================

Backround
=========

The City of Austin is using open data to increase transparency, efficiency, and opportunities for collaboration.

*"Open data is the idea that some data should be freely available to everyone to use and republish as they wish, without restrictions from copyright, patents or other mechanisms of control."*

   -- `Open Knowledge Foundation <https://okfn.org/opendata/>`_ via `Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data>`_, accessed March 2016

*"The City of Austin is committed to an open and transparent government. I believe this is an integral part of maintaining a vital and robust democracy."*

   -- Marc Ott, Austin City Manager, April 2015

Initiative goal
===============

The goal of the Open Data Initiative is to help City of Austin departments and staff to perform the open data responsibilities outlined in the Open Government Directive.

Authority
=========

In December 2011, Austin's City Council voted to officially support the adoption of an open government framework. In 2013, the City Manager delivered a four-point plan for making City operations more open. This plan, known as the Open Government Directive, identifies multiple performance expectations related to open data.
