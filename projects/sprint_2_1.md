The purpose of this document is to describe the sprint project that focuses on data quality, collaboration, and updating Austin’s open data portal. It identifies key stakeholders, goals, and documents to be delivered.

### Background

The City of Austin first deployed its Socrata-based open data portal website in November 2011 as part of the City’s open government strategy outlined by Resolution 20111208-74. Since then, the Communication and Technology Management Department has led initiatives and projects to increase support for and usage of open data practices, including most recently Sprint 2.0 in 2015. Sprint 2.1 seeks to continue the momentum sparked last year by reiterating the City’s commitment to “Open by Default”, using data more purposefully, and demonstrating positive impact on the community we serve. 

### Goals
- Develop and publish an inventory of public datasets held by the City of Austin
- Create a common set of core metadata standards to provide proper attribution to each data set
- Define and implement a process at the City for responding to requests for new open datasets
- Update the documentation of Austin’s open data assets on the [US Open Data Census](http://us-city.census.okfn.org/) website
- Update the design of the Open Data Portal
- Launch the Open Performance Dashboard
- Release data liaison SSPR language for user review and feedback
