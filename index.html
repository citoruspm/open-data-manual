<h1>Open data documentation...</h1>

<p>What if we had one site where we could find and manage all the documents related to open data at the City of Austin?</p>

<p>What if that site automatically tracked our document history so nothing gets lost?</p>

<p>What if the site was built for collaboration... so we could discuss our work out in the open and make it easy for people to learn how to pitch in?</p>

<p>How about a website that can be edited without downloads or coding? All for free?</p>

<p>Maybe this can be that site!</p>

<p>Let's keep building and see what happens...</p>



<!-- 
<p>Every document is a work in progress. (Coming soon), look for these badges to find out the development status of each document:</p>

<h4>Discovery <span class="badge discovery">?</span></h4>

<p>A short phase in which we start researching the needs of the document's users, find out what we should be measuring, and explore technological or policy-related constraints.</p>

<h4>Alpha <span class="badge alpha">a</span></h4>

<p>A short phase in which we prototype solutions for the document. We’ll be testing with a small group of users or stakeholders and getting early feedback about the document's content and layout.</p>

<h4>Beta <span class="badge beta">b</span></h4>

<p>We’re developing against the demands of a live environment, understanding how to review and revise while meeting user needs. We’ll also be releasing a version to test in public.</p>

<h4>Live <span class="badge live">L</span></h4>

<p>The document is considered "in effect", however work doesn’t stop at this stage. We’ll be iteratively improving the document, reacting to new needs and demands, and keeping track of the changes as we go.</p>
