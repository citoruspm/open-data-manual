***

we currently have two documents labeled as "Terms of Use" for open data

As a PDF resource on the data portal: [https://data.austintexas.gov/dataset/City-of-Austin-Open-Data-Terms-of-Use-Policy/2z87-8uh7](https://data.austintexas.gov/dataset/City-of-Austin-Open-Data-Terms-of-Use-Policy/2z87-8uh7) <br>

and following the Terms of Use link in the data portal nav bar pointing here: [http://www.austintexas.gov/coa-open-data-licensing](http://www.austintexas.gov/coa-open-data-licensing)

These may actually be licensing policies. 

If we need a TOU doc, here's a draft of a Terms of Use policy based on what San Francisco uses: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lK4gGZwppSmYedNfHyBfAEKowi78tT2l2hvNUhHMQA8/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lK4gGZwppSmYedNfHyBfAEKowi78tT2l2hvNUhHMQA8/edit?usp=sharing).
